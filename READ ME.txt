SNAKES AND LADDERS USING JAVA SWING:

This project contains a Game Package which has 2 classes for a blue board 
(GUI and listeners), 2 classes for a red board(GUI and listeners) and 1 class for a 
start screen of the game.

The StartScreen class is run and all further things are handled!
The "Blue" and "Red" folders contain images of each box of red and blue boards 
respectively. These images are imported in their respective classes using GUI swing
components inorder to form 2 boards. The user will be given a choice at the start of
the game to select the game on which he wants to play. 

After the user clicks on a board of his choice, the game begins.
